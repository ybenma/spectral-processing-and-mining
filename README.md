# spectral-processing-and-mining
Collection of spectral processing R code. Most of the code involves spectra preprocessing (normalizations, smoothing, derivatives), outlier dectection, and partial least sqaures regression and its variants. Applications of spectral models can be used for rapid analysis of biological and environmental matters. 

#### "Mine pro.R" 
This is a function written for explorotory spectral modelling using PLSR. The output gives the best performing preprocessing techqniue using leave-one-out crossvalidation.
